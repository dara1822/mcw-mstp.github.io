# Welcome!

I will place some of the "assignments" between each session here. I was thinking of jumping into programming, so I've come up with a task that I think would be difficult to do with excel.

## Week 1 (9/14/2023)
 - Download Milwaukee crime data for this year-to-date [https://data.milwaukee.gov/dataset/wibr](https://data.milwaukee.gov/dataset/wibr)
 - For a zip-code of your choosing, find the time of day with when the most thefts are reported.
    - Filter by zipcode
    - Convert time to `dateTime`
    - Take only the time of day
    - Create a moving average of number of thefts
    - Plot this, find the maximum
