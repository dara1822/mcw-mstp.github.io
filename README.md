Glad you're here. To work on this repository, there are two options:

1. You can simply edit any of the markdown (`.md`) files using the github online interface
2. You can clone the repository! This is a more involved task, but can be a good learning experience for creating documentation. It also allows you to have a local live version to see updates in realtime as you are making them, rather than waitning to the comits to be accepted and rendered online (can take up to a day). To to this, follow the instructions on the website under the 'contributions' tab. 

Cloning the repository can be done in the following way:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mcw-mstp/mcw-mstp.github.io.git
$ cd mcw-mstp.github.io
$ pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material mkdocs-material-extensions
$ mkdocs serve
```
Note: You will likely need to install `mkdocs-material`
